# Azure Serverless Computing Cookbook
In the past decade, Cloud computing has gained attention across various types and sizes of businesses to leverage features and cloud advantages like scalability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness. One of the major features of Cloud computing that gained popularity in recent years is serverless computing. With this, you only pay based on the number of executions and the resources that your work load consumes. Microsoft Offers serverless computing features via Azure Functions.

In order to leverage the features and benefits of Azure Functions, many companies are planning to start migrating (or re-writing) their existing backend systems into Azure Functions. With this, the demand for Azure Developers is increasing. Azure Functions not only provides various business benefits in terms of scalability and reliability, but, with the Azure ecosystem’s rich set of tools, it also helps developers implement various business-critical backend functionalities with a smaller number of LOC (lines of code). 

The Azure Serverless Computing cookbook guides the developer through the development of a basic backend Web Api that performs simple operations, and helps her/him to understand how to persist the data in Azure Storage Services. The next section covers the integration of Azure Functions with other cloud services, like Notification Services (Send Grid & Twilio) , Cognitive Services (Computer Vision), and Logic Apps, to build simple workflow-based applications.

The book also teaches developers to leverage the Visual Studio to quickly develop, build, test, and deploy the Azure Functions. It also talks about various tools and methods for testing the functionality of Azure Functions locally in the developer workstation and in the Cloud Environment.

Once the reader is familiar with various Azure features, the book will talk about some of the Advanced Azure concepts like Durable Functions starting with a Hello World example. We will then talk about a very common use case called the “Scalable Bulk Upload” which uses one of the Durable Function patterns, “Function Chaining & Fan-out / Fan-In”.

The books also covers various security elements that are required for working with Azure Functions and their integration with various services, like Managed Identify and Azure Key Vault as well as various advanced services like SignalR, Azure Data Factory, designed to increase productivity via their seamless connection with various Azure Serverless services.

Developers will also learn some of the industry’s best practices and automation for the efficient creation and deployment of applications into the UAT and Production environments.
