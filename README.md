# Azure Serverless Computing Cookbook
This third edition of Azure Serverless Computing Cookbook guides you through the development of a basic back-end web API that performs simple operations, helping you understand how to persist data in Azure Storage services. You'll cover the integration of Azure Functions with other cloud services, such as notifications (SendGrid and Twilio), Cognitive Services (computer vision), and Logic Apps, to build simple workflow-based applications.
With the help of this book, you'll be able to leverage Visual Studio tools to develop, build, test, and deploy Azure functions quickly. It also covers a variety of tools and methods for testing the functionality of Azure functions locally in the developer's workstation and in the cloud environment. Once you're familiar with the core features, you'll explore advanced concepts such as durable functions, starting with a "hello world" example, and learn about the scalable bulk upload use case, which uses durable function patterns, function chaining, and fan-out/fan-in.
By the end of this Azure book, you'll have gained the knowledge and practical experience needed to be able to create and deploy Azure applications on serverless architectures efficiently.

## What you will learn
* Implement continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) of Azure functions
* Develop different event-based handlers in a serverless architecture
* Integrate Azure functions with different Azure services to develop enterprise-level applications
* Accelerate your cloud application development using Azure function triggers and bindings
* Automate mundane tasks at various levels, from development to deployment and maintenance
* Develop stateful serverless applications and self-healing jobs using durable functions

### Software Requirement
For an optimal learning experience, we recommend the following configuration:
* Visual Studio 2019
* Storage Explorer
* Azure Functions Core Tools (formerly Azure CLI Tools)
* Processor: Intel Core i5 or equivalent
* Memory: 4 GB RAM (8 GB preferred)
* Storage: 35 GB available space
